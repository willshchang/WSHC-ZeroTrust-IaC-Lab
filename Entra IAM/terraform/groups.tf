# groups.tf
# This file manages the creation of Security Groups in Entra ID.

# ============================================================
# DATA DISCOVERY (ZERO-HARDCODE ARCHITECTURE)
# ============================================================
# We do not hardcode team names (like "ITOps" or "SRE"). 
# Instead, we look at the raw HR data parsed in users.tf and 
# dynamically build a list of whatever teams happen to exist.
# ============================================================

locals {
  # 1. Look at 'local.employees_raw' (which terraform loaded in users.tf)
  # 2. Extract every single 'team' value from that CSV.
  # 3. Use 'distinct()' to filter out duplicates, leaving a clean list of unique departments.
  unique_teams = distinct([for emp in local.employees_raw : emp.team])
}

# ============================================================
# DYNAMIC GROUP CREATION (THE "SELF-HEALING" LAYER)
# ============================================================
# Instead of Terraform manually writing names onto a guest list (Static),
# we tell Entra ID to enforce a dress code (Dynamic). 
# If a user's department attribute matches the group name, they are in.
# ============================================================

  # Loop through our dynamically generated list of unique teams

  # Activating this type hands the user-management workload over to Azure's internal engine.

# ============================================================
# THE "VIP" EXCLUSION GROUP (SECURITY LAYER)
# ============================================================
# This group is used specifically to bypass MFA and Legacy Auth.
# Unlike the team groups, this MUST remain Static. Access to bypass 
# security should always require deliberate, manual human intervention.

# PRIVILEGED ADMIN GROUPS (STATIC)
# ============================================================
# Microsoft requires groups holding Entra Roles to be Static.
# We generate these dynamically based on the tfvars role map.

# ============================================================
# THE BRIDGE: POPULATING THE STATIC ADMIN GROUPS
# ============================================================
# Because we cannot assign Entra roles to Dynamic groups, we must 
# explicitly place the admin users (ITOps/Security) from our CSV 
# into their respective Static groups.

# 1. Loop through the CSV users and add them if they belong to an admin team
resource "azuread_group_member" "csv_admin_members" {
  # Filter the employee list to ONLY include people in ITOps or Security

    if contains(keys(var.entra_role_map), emp.team)
  }

  group_object_id  = azuread_group.admin_groups[each.value.team].object_id
  member_object_id = azuread_user.employees[each.key].object_id
}

# 2. Add YOU (The Primary Admin) to the Static ITOps Group
# Since you were created outside the CSV, we map you explicitly.
resource "azuread_group_member" "primary_admin_itops" {
  group_object_id  = azuread_group.admin_groups["ITOps"].object_id
